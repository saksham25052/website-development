    <img class="about-band-image" src="playboicartisquare.jpg"/>  Jordan Terrell Carter (born September 13, 1996), known professionally as Playboi Carti, is an American rapper. Born and raised in Atlanta, Carter was initially signed to local underground label Awful Records prior to signing with ASAP Mob's AWGE Label under Interscope Records. After gaining a cult following early in his career, Carter garnered mainstream attention in 2017.
Carter's debut mixtape was released in April 2017, and included the Billboard Hot 100 charting singles "Magnolia" and "Woke Up Like This" (featuring Lil Uzi Vert). His debut studio album Die Lit (2018) peaked at number 3 on the US Billboard 200. Following a two-year hiatus with little new music released, Carter's highly anticipated second album, Whole Lotta Red (2020), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and became his first chart-topping release. 

<br> <br>Carti began rapping at an early age under the name Sir Cartier in 2011 and soon after changed it to Playboi Carti in 2013. He began uploading songs on SoundCloud in 2011. In 2014, after meeting producer Ethereal, he joined Awful Records. Carti credits Ethereal with helping him find his sound. Once Carti chose to pursue music full-time, he made the decision to move to New York City with some family. While in New York City, Carti stayed at his drug dealer's house, and members of ASAP Mob frequented the house. Eventually Carti ran into ASAP Bari, who eventually introduced him to ASAP Rocky. Carti decided to go Texas with ASAP Rocky.
<br> <br>He began to attract attention in 2015 with his singles "Broke Boi" and "Fetti" featuring Da$h and Maxo Kream, both of which were published to SoundCloud. Around this time, Carti frequently collaborated with artists in Atlanta's underground rap scene, including his cousin UnoTheActivist, Thouxanbanfauni, Yung Bans, Lil Yachty, Ethereal, and producers MexikoDro, and ICYTWAT. He began to tour with ASAP Ferg and Lil Uzi Vert, and he signed a deal with Interscope Records.
In 2016, he was featured on the A$AP Mob's single "Telephone Calls" from their album Cozy Tapes Vol. 1: Friends. The same year, Carti signed to the A$AP Mob's AWGE imprint.
